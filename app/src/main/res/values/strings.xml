        &#8226; Highest roll begins the game\n
        &#8226; The game is played in a clockwise direction\n
        &#8226; To enter the game you need to roll a 6\n
        &#8226; If no pieces are in play and no 6 is rolled, you skip your turn\n
        &#8226; You must always move a piece the amount shown by dice\n
        &#8226; If a 6 is rolled you can either move 6 or enter another piece into play, and roll again\n
        &#8226; Upon the third 6 rolled in a row, you forfeit your turn\n
        &#8226; You can not land on your own piece, ERGO NO STACKING\n
        &#8226; If you land on another players piece, you send the piece back to the home area\n \n
